# Behavioral Interview Preparation Grid

## Overview
The Preparation Grid is a systematic approach to organizing your stories and examples before interviews. This method, popularized by "Cracking the Coding Interview," helps ensure you have relevant examples for all common question types.

## How to Use This Grid

1. **Identify Key Projects/Experiences**: List 5-7 significant projects or experiences from your career
2. **Fill in the Grid**: For each project, identify examples of different competencies
3. **Prepare STAR Stories**: Write out full STAR format answers for each cell
4. **Practice**: Rehearse your stories until they flow naturally

## The Grid Template

| Project/Experience | Leadership | Challenges | Conflicts | Mistakes/Failures | Success | Innovation |

| **Payment System Integration** | Made decision to refactor during integration | Third-party API limitations, compliance requirements | Difficult client expectations | Missed initial deadline by 1 week | Achieved PCI compliance, processed $2M in first month |

## How to Fill Your Grid

### Step 1: List Your Projects
Identify 5-7 significant projects or experiences. Include:
- Recent work (within last 2-3 years is most relevant)
- Diverse projects (different technologies, team sizes, challenges)
- Projects with measurable impact
- Both successes and learning experiences

### Step 2: For Each Project, Ask Yourself:

**Leadership**:
- Did I lead any part of this project?
- Did I mentor or guide others?
- Did I make important decisions?

**Challenges**:
- What was difficult about this project?
- What technical problems did I solve?
- What obstacles did we overcome?

**Conflicts**:
- Were there disagreements?
- How did I handle differing opinions?
- Did I need to manage difficult relationships?

**Mistakes/Failures**:
- What went wrong?
- What would I do differently?
- What did I learn?

**Success**:
- What did we achieve?
- What was the measurable impact?
- How did this exceed expectations?

**Innovation**:
- What creative solutions did I develop?
- Did I improve any processes?
- Did I take initiative beyond my role?

### Step 3: Write STAR Stories
For each cell in your grid, prepare a STAR-format story:

```
Project: [Project Name]
Category: [Leadership/Challenges/etc.]

Situation: [Brief context]
Task: [Your specific responsibility]
Action: [What you did - detailed]
Result: [Outcomes with metrics]
Learning: [What you learned]
```

### Step 4: Practice and Refine
- Practice telling each story out loud
- Time yourself (aim for 2-3 minutes)
- Refine based on feedback
- Ensure stories flow naturally

## Tips for a Strong Grid

### Diversity is Key
✅ Include variety:
- Different types of projects
- Various team sizes (solo, small team, large team)
- Different roles (individual contributor, lead, mentor)
- Mix of successes and failures

### Quantify Everything
✅ Add numbers to your grid:
- Team size: "Led team of 5 developers"
- Time: "Completed in 6 weeks"
- Impact: "Improved performance by 40%"
- Scale: "System handling 1M requests/day"

### Keep It Recent
✅ Focus on recent work:
- Last 2-3 years is most relevant
- Shows current skills and maturity
- Easier to remember details

### One Story, Multiple Uses
✅ A single project can answer many questions:
- Same story with different emphasis
- Highlight relevant aspects based on question
- Be flexible in your storytelling
