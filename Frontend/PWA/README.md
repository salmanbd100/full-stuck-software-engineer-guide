# Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

## Introduction

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a revolutionary approach to web development that combine the best features of web and mobile applications. PWAs deliver native app-like experiences in the browser with offline capabilities, fast loading, and installability. This is an increasingly important interview topic as PWAs become standard practice for modern web applications.

### Why PWAs Matter in Interviews

- **Modern Development**: PWAs represent the evolution of web development
- **Real-World Applications**: Major companies (Twitter, Spotify, Pinterest) use PWAs
- **User Experience**: Demonstrates understanding of performance and UX
- **Technical Depth**: Requires knowledge of service workers, caching, and offline-first architecture
- **Trending Technology**: Shows you're up-to-date with current best practices

### What Interviewers Look For

1. Understanding of PWA principles and core technologies
2. Knowledge of service worker lifecycle and cache strategies
3. Ability to implement offline-first applications
4. Understanding of web app manifests and installation
5. Experience with tools like Workbox
6. Real-world PWA implementation patterns

---

## Core PWA Principles

### Progressive Enhancement
Applications work for every user, regardless of browser choice, with enhanced experiences for those with modern browsers.

### Responsive Design
Works seamlessly on all devices - phones, tablets, desktops, and wearables.

### Connectivity Independence
Service workers enable offline functionality, slow network resilience, and background operations.

### App-Like Interface
Navigation and interactions resemble native applications, not web pages.

### Fresh & Safe
Served over HTTPS to ensure content integrity and security.

### Discoverable & Installable
Web app manifests and service workers make PWAs discoverable and installable like native apps.

  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then(response => response || fetch(event.request))
  );
});

// Network First: Use network, fallback to cache
// Best for: API calls, dynamic content
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    fetch(event.request)
      .then(response => {
        return caches.open('api-cache').then(cache => {
          cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
          return response;
        });
      })
      .catch(() => caches.match(event.request))
  );
});

// Stale-While-Revalidate: Serve from cache, update in background
// Best for: Images, fonts, non-critical API data
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then(cached => {
      const fetchPromise = fetch(event.request).then(response => {
        caches.open('cache').then(cache => cache.put(event.request, response.clone()));
        return response;
      });
      return cached || fetchPromise;
    })
  );
});

  try {
    const reg = await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');
    console.log('SW registered:', reg);

});

registerServiceWorker();
```

    if (cached) return cached;

    try {
      const response = await fetch(request);
      cache.put(request, response.clone());

## PWA vs Native Apps

| Aspect | PWA | Native App |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| **Install** | One-click, no store | App store process |
| **Update** | Automatic, transparent | User dependent |
| **Size** | Small (1-5 MB typically) | Large (100+ MB) |
| **Offline** | Yes (with service workers) | Always offline-capable |
| **Hardware Access** | Limited | Full access |
| **Development** | Single codebase | Platform-specific |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |
| **Discoverability** | Web search | App stores |

---

## Common Interview Questions (Detailed)

### Question 1: What are the three main pillars of PWA?

**Answer:** The three main pillars are:

1. **Progressive Enhancement** - Works for every user regardless of browser support
2. **Offline-First** - Service workers enable offline functionality and reliability
3. **App-Like** - Responsive, installable, and provides native app experience

---

### Question 2: Explain the service worker lifecycle

**Answer:** Service workers have three main states:

1. **Registration** - `navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')`
2. **Installation** - `install` event fires, cache assets
3. **Activation** - `activate` event fires, clean old caches
4. **Fetch Handling** - Intercept and respond to network requests

See [01-service-workers.md](./01-service-workers.md) for detailed examples.

---

### Question 3: When would you use each caching strategy?

**Answer:**

- **Cache First**: Static assets (CSS, JS, images) - fast loading, updated infrequently
- **Network First**: API calls, content that needs fresh data
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Best of both - serve fast while updating background
- **Cache Only**: Assets that never change
- **Network Only**: Content that requires fresh data always

See [03-offline-patterns.md](./03-offline-patterns.md) for implementation details.

---

### Question 4: How do you update a service worker?

**Answer:** Service workers update through version changes:

1. Update the service worker file code
2. Browser detects change and fires `install` event
3. New SW enters "waiting" state
4. Use `skipWaiting()` to activate immediately, or wait for all clients to close
5. Existing clients need to reload page or use message passing

See [01-service-workers.md](./01-service-workers.md) for update patterns.

---

### Question 5: What are the installation requirements for a PWA?

**Answer:** Minimum requirements:

1. HTTPS (or localhost for development)
2. Valid manifest.json with name, short_name, icons, start_url
3. Service worker registered and activated
4. Icons (192x192, 512x512 minimum)
5. Display mode set in manifest

See [02-web-app-manifest.md](./02-web-app-manifest.md) for detailed requirements.

---

## Real-World PWA Examples

### Production PWAs
- **Twitter Lite** - 3G-optimized, offline capable
- **Spotify Web** - Full offline playback, native-like interface
- **Pinterest** - 50% faster, 66% less data, offline support
- **Google Maps** - Works offline with cached maps
- **Notion** - Offline first, syncs when online

### Why Companies Use PWAs
1. Improved performance and user experience
2. Reduced development costs (single codebase)
3. Better engagement than responsive websites
4. App-store independence
5. Easy distribution and updates

---

## Performance Metrics
